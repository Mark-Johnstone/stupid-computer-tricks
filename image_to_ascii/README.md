This takes a jpeg file (input_image.jpg) and converts the image to the following files and formats:
*  output_no_background.png = the original image, but with the background replaced with a white background
*  output_ascii.txt = the image converted to ascii text art
*  output_png.png = the ascii text art image converted to a .png file so it can be used as a profile/avatar image at various sites
